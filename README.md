lcm_gcd_factorial_inverse_C
===========================

If select=0 then your C-code should calculate Least Common Multiple of two inputs.  If select=1 then your C-code should calculate Greatest Common Divisor of two inputs.  If select=2 then your C-code should calculate Factorial of first input.  If select=3 then your C-code should calculate inverse of second input.(e.g. the inverse of 123 is 321)
